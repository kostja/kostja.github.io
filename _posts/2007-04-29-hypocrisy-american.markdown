MySQL Users Conference was a great success.
Oh, screw that.

I don't actually think it was. I just keep hearing this sentence in
announcements and press-releases year after year and my structure-seeking
brain classified the sentence as a set phrase.

But the conference was okay.

Good tracks, decent food, a lot of new engineers from our new and numerous
storage engine building partners. I don't know if it was good value for the
money, since I didn't have pay a dime - I was a speaker, and the conference
organizers paid the admission fee for me, while the company covered the
expenses. But it certainly was a good use of time.
