title:  How to not screw up work/life balance
---

A lot of thinking recently has been devoted to getting a life.
Currently I can not have a life and also get my work done the way I want.
I've been watching people who seemed to be more effective, bugging them with silly questions, making observations about my own biorhythms and here is what I found:

 - I'm a night owl. My peak hours are in the evening. I can work late into the night easily
 - I need one hour just to think over the events of the day before I can fall asleep.
 - my performance depends on my mood 
 - I have a sort of attention deficit disorder - I naturally switch to thinking about something else when encounter a predicament with the current task. 

People who manage to actually have a life and also get things done are:
 - early birds
 - priorities driven. I can't believe they are actually not dependent on the mood: rather, it seems, they have deeply internalized the priorities and their mood is a function of the priorities.
 - it seems they can actually focus a lot better than I do.
 - they are not more physically capable than I am. On the contrary, they spend more time to take care of their physical health than I do. I don't listen to my body carefully enough and thus can easily drive myself to exhaustion.
