Spring is a conference season.

<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/">MySQL Users Conference</a> and <a href="http://ritconf.ru/">RIT</a> are behind, but I have two more engagements in the upcoming weeks:
- <a href="http://event.perlrussia.org/mayperl4/">YAPC Russia</a>, on Tarantool/Box key/value storage
- <a href="http://devconf.ru">DevConf</a>, on methods of regression testing of 24/7 server applications.

As usual, I'm always happy, with my Moscow MySQL User Group founder hat, to talk about the current state of everything in MySQL.

See you at the conferences!
