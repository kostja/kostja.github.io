title:   munmap() performance on Linux
---

munmap() is slow on Linux, and it is linear from the chunk size. 
I have known about it for a while, but haven't got a chance to investigate why.

Anyone knows the reason? The problem is so serious that when working with large memory volumes Tarantool has to fork off a separate thread just to do munmap(), to avoid serious latency issues in the connection thread.

This morning I got a chance to actually <a href="http://pastebin.com/9HgqS3Tv">write a test program</a> and measure the impact.
An interesting result is that it gets relatively faster with a larger chunk.

PS If you have Solaris/Darwin/FreeBSD at hand, I would love if you repeat the program and paste your numbers.
