title: Impressions from Stockholm
---

OK, I am in Stockholm, at a development meeting. Stockholm is a nice city.
It has soul, and it is  smart. Probably the best European capital I've been
to. 

This is my first impression - so far I've seen only a few quarters and the
road from the airport. But something tells me it'll stay that way. Maybe I
need not see the city and an image is ready made. I like the roads, the
houses with walls that are 4-5 bricks thick. And it's the first airport with
oaken parquetry floors I've been to.

Tomorrow is a day to revisit some prehistoric server problems, such as <a

my lot.
