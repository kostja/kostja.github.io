title:   Corporate Databases 2006
---

Glanced at <a href="http://citforum.ru/seminars/cbd2006/#program">the
program of annual conference "Corporate Databases 2006"</a> and discovered
that this year there is no MySQL session.

Interesting, did Sergey Kuznetsov
simply forget about us? Dmitri's feedback from the last year's conference
(he was presenting) doesn't fill me with enthusiasm to try to submit a new
talk. In short, attendance sucks. The idea is rather muddy too, as right now
it's basically trying to gather competing vendors together and have them
present their products one after another.

No need to be a salesman to understand that it doesn't work.  There is no
conference in Russia dedicated to database research that I'm aware of,
otherwise I would attend one.
