title:   A better MySQL CHECKSUM TABLE, fixing Bug#39474
---

The current MySQL table checksum is very simple: it's basically the same as
CRC32(CONCAT(all data in the table)).

Since long ago we've had <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/39474">customers
complain about the algorithm</a>, but one doesn't change such things every
day.

Now the time has come to make the change. 
The only question is how much should the checksum formula be changed?
Is it sufficient to just fix <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/39474">Bug#39474</a> or should we take the opportunity to do more?

* Is crc32 a good enough function for a checksum? Should we start using some other hash function?
* Should checksum change when table metadata changes? I.e. when you change
  the underlying data type? What about changing the table comment? Order of
columns in the table?
* Any other issues we should address along the way?

Your input is much appreciated!
