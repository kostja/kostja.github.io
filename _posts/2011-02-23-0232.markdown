Tarantool 1.3.4 is out. This is a stable release in stable series, but with
a lot of infrastructure changes. Suffice to say it's the first release that
has 'make test' target in the build scripts. The changelog is currently best
seen through Launchpad, https://launchpad.net/tarantool/1.3/1.3.4, a sane
user manual and changelog are still in the works.
