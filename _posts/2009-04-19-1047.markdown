title:   Working in Hyatt Regency Santa Clara
---

I'm in Santa Clara since yesterday, at MySQL Users Conference.

This will be my fifth conference: I missed only one since 2003. I was
supposed to come as a guest, but my friend and colleague Dmitri didn't get a
US visa, so I am speaking in his stead. Me and Peter Gulutzan will present
new all-engine foreign keys. Oh. 

So I'm working from Hyatt. It's a great sunny day, the air here is clear and
fresh, and everybody is enjoying the weekend.  Well, as mentioned, except
me, and maybe Drizzle developers, who already started Drizzle developer
conference :)

Musing about this all, I took a step back, and thought: so typical of me:
