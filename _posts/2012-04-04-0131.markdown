Today at a conference I was approached with a task, typical for a modern web app.

We have a chat system, and need to store and show all messages in the system.
There is no limit as to how long you store, and how much you can see.

There are two types of queries: 
- get all incoming messages for a given user, in chronological order, with pagination.
- show a dialogue of two users, in chronological order, with pagination.

A user is identified by 32 bit uid. 
A message can be uniquely identified by sender_uid and created_time (32 bit), or uid (destination user) and created_time.

If you store the whole thing in a single table, &lt;uid, created_time, sender_uid, message &gt, you're messed up with random reads when you need to show  a user inbox in chronological order. 

If you store the same message in two places, you get the same mess, but at write time. 

How do you best approach this? Is there a canonical solution? Column store? 

Thanks,
