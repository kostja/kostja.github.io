title:   Trying to conserve the sunshine of Crimea
---

People come strong, and grow weak in the city. It's just too big. That's
banal but so true for me. All the energy accumulated in Crimea I lost in the
last few days, while trying to push the paperwork for my studio. As if I was
another person in Crimea. More cheerful, more understanding.

The puzzle of
the last days is how to preserve.
