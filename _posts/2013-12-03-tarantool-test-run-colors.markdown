title: Adding colors to Tarantool test-run
---

Making people do what you want them to do is impossible. They seem to always
do what **they** want to do. 

Do we need <a href="https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/85">syntax
highlighting</a> in the command line client? Probably. Do we need it now?
Definitely not. 

But do we need colors in the [test runner](http://github.com/tarantool/test-run)?

Yeah, in 2025, perhaps! But we do have it now. And there is nothing I can do
about it.

Except <a href="https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/149">this little
revenge</a>.
