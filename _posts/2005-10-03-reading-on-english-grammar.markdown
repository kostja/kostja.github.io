When on a buying spree, I often buy more books than am ever able to read. This is exactly what happened when I last time was in an American bookstore, looking for a book that explains the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive clauses. Here's what I bought back then in April:

<b>"MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers" by Joseph Garibaldi, sixth edition</b>

To start with, this is not a grammar book. That is, it contains a chapter about punctuation, but mostly reels off on issues of style and formatting. If you're looking for a standard for formatting of research documents, citing, underlining, quoting, working with different sources, this book is for you. Its writing style is very comprehensible, if not too verbose: the book is written for college students. An entire chapter is devoted to plagiarism and how to avoid it. Read some chapters and some barely skimmed trhough.

<b>"Grammatically CORRECT" by Anne Stilman</b>

This book I liked. It contains a comprehensive guide for punctuation, explains how to avoid spelling errors, and has a very good chapter titled "Grammar" with excellent tips on how to make a complex sentence easy to read. A big deal though is that I not only need to read the book, but also make sure its rules and guidelines are an everyday practice.

<b>"Practical English Usage" by Michael Swan</b>

This is an alphabetically sorted list of all the existing grammar and punctuation rules in English. Should be an excellent replacement for numerous "English as a second language" textbooks I have. Haven't had a chance to use it extensively so far.
