title: Fascinated by Madonna lyrics - Jump
---

There’s only so much you can learn in one place  
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste  
  
I haven’t got much time to waste, it’s time to make my way  
I’m not afraid of what I’ll face, but I’m afraid to stay  
I’m going down my own road and I can make it alone  
I'll work and I'll fight, Till I find a place of my own  
Are you ready to jump?  
Get ready to jump  
Don’t ever look back, oh baby,  
Yes, I’m ready to jump  
Just take my hands  
Get ready to jump  

We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me  
The only thing you can depend on is your family  
And life’s gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree  
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see.
