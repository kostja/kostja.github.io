title:   Debian repository with Tarantool packages
---

As part of our regular build procedure, we now maintain a .deb archive with most recent stable builds:
<pre>
sudo echo "deb http://tarantool.org/dist/debian/ unstable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tarantool
</pre>
