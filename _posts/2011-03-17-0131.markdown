title:   Looking for people to join Tarantool development team -- Russian job search sites need some love
---

The plague of Russian engineering job market is that anyone who has even a
handful of talent and/or ambition, by 30 either becomes a manager or moves
abroad -- almost no Russian engineering company has a technical career
track, sufficiently understands or values technical skills. This makes
search for talented engineers rather difficult -- and sometimes fun, like on
the screenshot below. It's a search form on a recruiting site, and I attempt
to filter out all kinds of job titles (almost) all meaning the same - "the
boss" :-)
