title:   Unity day 
---

I have a renovation team plastering &amp; painting my apartment. Quite commonly, these workers are from Central Asia - Tajikis, Uzbeks. I, however, hired a nice &quot;Rossiyanin&quot; team composed of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuvash_people">Chuvash</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars">Tatar</a> and a Russian fellow - all indigenous nationalities.<br />One of them, Ruslan, got beaten on the weekend, by a bunch of skinheads. Black eyes and all the rest. He says he had a lucky escape, and things could get much worse.<br />This is how we celebrated the Unity day.<br /><br />I remember another episode, from my first renovation. It was an apartment on 5th store of a Stalin apartment block, now sold. No elevator.<br />In it, I had a nice heavy Soviet cast iron bath tube -- maybe 100 kilograms or heavier. And I needed to get rid of it.<br />So I hired a small Central Asia team of 3 emaciated fellows who agreed to take the thing out. In mere 30 minutes they were able to drag it to the garbage container, where they were stopped by a militia patrol. Only to pay the bribe of just earned 500 rubles: their registration papers weren&#39;t right.
