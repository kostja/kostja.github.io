The more I read the book the more I wondered what's his personal love story. There is a <a href="http://www.wodehouse.ru">Russian Wodehouse Society</a>, which has a biography. There I also found that his complete bibliography is more than 80 volumes.

Apart from excellence of the novels, learning from his use of English was as fruitful as if I was reading a class-book.
