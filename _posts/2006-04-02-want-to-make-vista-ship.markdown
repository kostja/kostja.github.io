categories: engineering
---

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch">Grady Booch</a> in his <a
href="http://www.booch.com/architecture/blog.jsp">blog</a> provides an
insightful analysis of the recent **Windows Vista** slip. 
A striking citation:

> Want to see Vista ship? Get rid of 90% of the process
> that goes between writing the code and getting it checked in.". Sounds
> familiar, isn't it? Happily we're currently dealing with recompilation and
> regression test delays, but policies are also likely to become an issue as
> we grow.
