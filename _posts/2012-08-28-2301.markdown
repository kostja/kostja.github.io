<i>We have it at 7001 Tower Rd, Denver, Colorado 80249.<br />You can pick it up 8am to noon and 1pm to 4:30 pm M-F.<br /><br />If you cannot pick it up, we can send it via FedEx.<br />If you want us to FedEx it, please provide us with a<br />FedEx account number or email us a FedEx label.<br /><br />If you choose to provide us with a FedEx account number you can call Fed Ex at<br />+1-800-463-3339 to obtain one.<br />We will need an address to send it to and a phone number also.<br />Be aware that FedEx does not ship to a P O Box.<br />Please specify if you would like it sent FedEx ground or FedEx Express.<br />You can ask FedEx how much it will cost when you talk to them.</i><br /><br /><br />I lost my wallet a million times, but it&#39;s the first time someone&#39;s actually trying to return it.<br />Something you can love about America only if you know the difference.
