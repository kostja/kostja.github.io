title:   Why active listening fails
---

<strong>Teacher</strong>: You know, we didn't have the time to get to know one another when you first came here, but I want you to know that I am not the kind of woman who'd let down a child, whatever her situation, whatever her mistake.<br />So, I'm going to help you and do my best to welcome you here again. But on one condition. You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda. I want you to take a chance and trust me. Now tell me what happened to you.<br /><br /><strong>Mathilda</strong>: OK. My family got shot down by DEA officers because of a drug problem. I left with the greatest guy on earth.<br /><br />&lt;...&gt;<br /><br />The book says you should be more trying to listen and understand. <br />People often do listen. But sometimes things are beyond what you can comprehend.
