A few recent books:

<b>"Foundation for Future Database Systems. The Third Manifesto" by C.J. Date and Hugh Darwen.</b>
An interesting and controversial book. In many cases completely rejects some practical arguments for the sake of purity of the model. A funny book too, as according to it, SQL is not a true relational language, which is a good reference to use when fingers are pointed at MySQL not being a relational database. Also gave a valuable insight why <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/5719">Bug#5719</a> should not be fixed. Despite this high appraisal, I don't think the book matches its title.

<b>"C++ Coding Standards" by <a href="http://www.gotw.ca">Herb Sutter</a> and <a href="http://erdani.org">Andrei Alexandrescu</a></b>.
A must-have book for C++ programmers, 200 pages of best programming style practices: basically, a summary of well-known sources, but now from the horse's mouth.

<b>"Exceptional C++ Style" by <a href="http://www.gotw.ca">Herb Sutter</a></b>. Looks like the contents of the book is available online, just like it was with "Exceptional C++". I liked the previous book, so I bought (but haven't read yet) this one too.
