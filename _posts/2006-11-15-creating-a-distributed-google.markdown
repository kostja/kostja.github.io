title:  Creating a new Google - a distributed one
---

The world needs a technology when search interface and search databases can
be run by different companies.

I'm thinking of a number of competing sites that are focused solely on
indexing Russia or Ukraine and selling search information to Web portals and
news sites all over the world.

A company like Google or Microsoft would need to contract with dozens of
search companies that are distributed geographically and pay revenue for
every click-through. 

Technology-wise this needs the search technology to
become distributed, for this to happen economically the technology must
become a commodity (open source).
