title:   What makes a company an "animal farm"?
---

&lt;&lt;Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart. Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of "I will work harder! "&gt;&gt;

Things start going wrong when a Squealer comes to the scene -- the one who is good at making speeches but doesn't work. Watch out?
