title:   A new look of tarantool.org
---

<p>After sitting for more than two months on a branch, a new, <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org">static CMS</a>-based layout finally got filled up with content (mostly) and made its way to the <a href="http://tarantool.org">web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yay :)
</p>
<p>
The logo is not finished yet. We needed something shorter than tar@antool, and a contraction of 'T', 'n' and 't' wins hands down in this respect :).
