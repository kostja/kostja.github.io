title:   Why open source is second best after sliced bread
---

Tonight in the Moscow English Communication Club I enjoyed an
interesting conversation with a member of <a
href="http://www.freestateproject.org">http://www.freestateproject.org</a>.
We were arguing whether Universal Ethics exist or not, and if it does exist, 
whether it has to be self-evident or not.
Stephen was aware and very supportive of the Open Source movement.

This got me thinking. Having been on board for almost 4 years, I've had a
chance to read a lot of introduction letters, talk to people from
whatever-the-current-number-is different countries, origins, beliefs. We
have everyone in the company, vegans and catholics, atheists and Jehovah's
witnesses. Everyone inside and outside share the same belief - that open
source is a good thing.

This sounds like abandoning slavery - the idea is in the set of core values
of practically everyone.

No matter what the business model is, whether we as a company cross the
chasm or not, there will be a product and organization that will tip.

This is encouraging :)
