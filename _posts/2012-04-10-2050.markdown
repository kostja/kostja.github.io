title:   What's new in Tarantool 1.4.5
---

<div><a href="http://tarantool.org/download.html">1.4.5</a> comes loaded with a bunch of fixes:</div><ul><li>a new WAL I/O algorithm, increasing write-bound performance&nbsp;by at least 70%. The patch both lowers request processing&nbsp;latency, which gives us the lower performance boundary in single-connection benchmarks, and increases write throughput,&nbsp;giving 200%+ increase in multi-threaded write workloads,</li><li>use hardware CRC32 to calculate checksums when writing&nbsp;to the write ahead log,</li><li>it&#39;s now possible to push, pop, insert and delete fields&nbsp;in the middle of a tuple with UPDATE. Since&nbsp;one can pack multiple UPDATE commands into a single request, and these commands are then executed&nbsp;atomically, this is the most primitive&nbsp;form of multi-statement transaction support (other transaction features are in the pipeline),</li><li>more compact and efficient TREE indexes,</li><li>reverse iterators: you can now browse an index in reverse order,</li><li>positioned iteration over a multi-part index: it&#39;s possible&nbsp;to position an iterator in Lua using only a prefix of a&nbsp;multipart key, and retrieve all tuples which match the&nbsp;prefix,</li><li>full support of 64-bit integers in Lua (in addition to 32-bit&nbsp;integers, which we supported since 1.3),</li><li>a couple of dozen of bugfixes.</li></ul>Whoever is using 1.4.4 I warmly recommend an upgrade: the performance boost is worth it. The release is fully backward compatible, and the team is on stand-by to fix anything our test coverage didn&#39;t catch.
