title: Life in Google for an outsider
---

Visited Google campus today. All I could infer as an outsider, 
is that Google is burning a lot of money.

Bathrooms at the campus in Mountain View have heated seats... 
Wee...

And no person at Google would tell you what they are working on, open source projects are a rare exception.

Silicon Valley crowd for some reason thinks that hiring out all A+ grade kids is a smart way to spend money.

Huh.
