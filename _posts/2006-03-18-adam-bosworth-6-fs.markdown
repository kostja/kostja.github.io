title:   Adam Bosworth's six Fs
---

While in Sorrento at a management team kick off, we had a guest lecture
by [Adam Bosworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bosworth").

Among many things, he spoke about company values. To achieve team 
cohesion, all company employees need at least a subset of these core values:

* **Fame** - become famous, by making a great product
* **Fortune** - money is king, earn a fortune, everything else comes second
* **Family** - this job is good for your family, either by providing you with enough money and time for the family or by being your family
* **Freedom** - being able to do what you want at work. You lose it when you get the first customer
* **Fun** - because your work is fun
* **Force** - because your work gives you a chance to improve lives of many people.

Any team can pick no more than two for its set of core values.
When joining a company, make sure you share the core values of the team
you join.
