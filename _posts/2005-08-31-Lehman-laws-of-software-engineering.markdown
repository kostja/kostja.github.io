While reading <a
href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Software_Engineering.html?id=DoJQAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y&hl=en">"Software Engineering"</a> by <a href="http://www.software-engin.com/">Ian Sommerville</a> found a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution" alt="The best link I could find online">Lehman laws</a>.

An insightful mirror of my own observations.

I - **Continuing Change** An E-type program that is used must be continually adapted else it becomes progressively less satisfactory.

II - **Increasing Complexity**: As a program is evolved its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.

III - **Self Regulation** The program evolution process is self regulating with close to normal distribution of measures of product and process attributes.

IV - **Conservation of Organisational Stability** (invariant work rate) The average effective global activity rate on an evolving system is invariant over the product life time.

V - **Conservation of Familiarity** During the active life of an evolving program, the content of successive releases is statistically invariant.

VI - **Continuing Growth** Functional content of a program must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime.

VII - **Declining Quality** E-type programs will be perceived as of declining quality unless rigorously maintained and adapted to a changing operational
environment.

VIII - **Feedback System** E-type Programming Processes constitute Multi-loop, Multi-level Feedback systems and must be treated as such to be successfully
modified or improved.
