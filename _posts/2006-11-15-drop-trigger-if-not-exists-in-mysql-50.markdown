title:   DROP TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS is in MySQL 5.0
categories:      mysql

Despite a hard stop for new features in 5.0, <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/23703">we are adding IF EXISTS syntax</a> to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/drop-trigger.html">DROP TRIGGER statement</a>.
I wonder what needs to happen to have basic SIGNAL functionality added. I tried to implement it a few months ago and it didn't seem bigger than a task for a few days. 
So, I'm looking for ideas how to make addition of SIGNAL to 5.0 a no-brainer decision. Should our community run a charity auction with this feature on stake?
Finding a customer from <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/">Fortune 500</a> that would declare they can't use our product without it might prove more effective :)
