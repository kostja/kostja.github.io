title:   Buildbot rant
---

In order for a continuous integration system to be effective, it needs to be actually working.

I.e. bug-free. I.e. it needs to be continually tested, I guess.&nbsp;

We&#39;ve been using Buildbot and have been extremely *un*happy with it. A single little piece of this twisted monster, the GitPoller plug-in, is messing up the whole set-up.

When it stops,&nbsp;sorry, no more changes, and hence no more builds. And the damn thing is so badly written that it does stop. At first it used to stop when a branch with a specific name would show up in the tree. We fixed it. Then it turned out that it also stops when a few attempts to reach github have failed. We&#39;ve fixed that too. Why it doesn&#39;t work now, I don&#39;t want to know.
