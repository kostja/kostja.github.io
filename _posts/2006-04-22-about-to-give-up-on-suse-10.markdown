title:   Why I'm about to give up using SuSE 10
categories:      linux, suse

<a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2006/01/21/giving-up-on-suse-linux-10/">A blog entry on why SuSE doesn't rock any more</a>, and I have similar feelings. After installation of the recent system updates, my WiFi stopped working in WPA-PSK mode, and I believe this is not a hardware problem, as the card works well with no encryption. My gut feeling is that the problem is with SuSE's wpa_supplicant package, but all my attempts to find an SuSE RPM for a later version were to no avail.
Will need to clean up this mess when I get home.
