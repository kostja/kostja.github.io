Art principles applied to engineering imply that software must be imperfect. Uh, that's all right, it's always imperfect :)... but no, on the second thought it's often just bad,
while I actually meant that it must be as imperfect as our world is. I wonder if it's possible to achieve that using engineering principles only.

But this is all rhetoric, what I actually meant is that the way to perfection doesn't have to start from a point which is of any value per se.
