So, I decided to present her with a couple of tickets to a good play,
thinking what a brilliant idea would that be -- two tickets, one girl, an
allusion to asking me to make her a party.

And she accepted the tickets and thanked me. Probably is going to go there
with her girlfriend, or some blighter, even better.

Yes, what a brilliant  thought of yours, my tactful friend.
