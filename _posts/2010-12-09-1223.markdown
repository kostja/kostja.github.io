title:   Speaking at O'Reilly MySQL Conference!
---

Yay! My talk on new metadata locking in 5.5 was accepted to the 
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011">O'Reilly MySQL Conference</a>

I'm happy to be given a chance to come and visit this place again (7th time!), especially since I know that it reinvents itself every year. 

This year it's going to be different: as far as I can see, there is close to no participation in the conference on the Oracle side, and the content is being provided almost fully by the rest of the community. 
Nothing to worry about if one looks for best talks -- last year's most popular sessions were delivered by Percona and Monty Program speakers anyway -- but very likely this year's participation will be, as in good old days, fewer suites and more engineers.
