title:   MySQL 5.5 innodb_buffer_pool_instances should be set automatically

<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances">innodb_buffer_pool_instances</a>
is, perhaps, the single most important tuning parameter in MySQL 5.5. And
the default of 1 severely caps MySQL performance on any recent hardware.

A more reasonable default is called for, e.g. (innodb_buffer_pool_size in
GB + number of CPUs)/2.

This observation is coming from my recent experience of "first run" tuning of MySQL 5.5 on several installations: this is the first thing that was changed on all of them.
