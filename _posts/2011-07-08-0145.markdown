title:   Tarantool, yet another 1.4 feature made it into 'master' branch
---

This week we pushed a new implementation of Memcached protocol support. Up until now, Tarantool had a special "memcached" mode, working as a persistent replacement for the traditional memcached install.
Since Tarantool connectors are still rather scarce, we decided to split the caching logic from the protocol logic.
From now on, memcached protocol is just another protocol Tarantool supports, and it is used when you bind to 
<a href="http://tarantool.org/tarantool_user_guide.html#memcached_port">memcached_port</a>. Memcached protocol doesn't imply memcached expire, and you <a href="http://tarantool.org/tarantool_user_guide.html#memcached_expire">can turn expire on/off</a> separately. 

Memcached now works correctly in local hot standby mode and on a replica.
