title: Bug#12713
---

Since about 20 months after start, a solution for <a
href="http://bugs.mysql.com/12713">Bug#12713</a> finally reached the main
tree.

If you're not using stored functions this may have a very little effect on
you, since other than fixing the problem at hand it was no more than a
cleanup of the execution flow and the server/storage engine interaction.
Anyway, it was a difficult one, one out of a dozen of design gotchas we
added to the server with 5.0. The all-time record for that sort of difficult
bugs

is <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/989">Bug#989</a>, reported back in 2003
and planned for a fix in  6.0 only.
